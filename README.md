# Email-Spam-Detection
The project aimed to develop a machine learning-based solution for detecting whether an email is ham or spam. The solution involved the implementation of three popular algorithms - naive bayes, logistic regression, and support vector machine. The primary goal was to provide the user with the flexibility to choose the algorithm that best suited their requirements. The project's architecture included a web application built using Streamlit, a popular open-source Python library for creating interactive data science applications. The application enabled the user to paste the content of the email and select the algorithm they wanted to use to detect if the email was spam or ham.
